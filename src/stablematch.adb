-- Program to solve arbitrary instances of the hospitals residents problem

-- Author: Rob Irving, University of Glasgow

-- Input is as follows:
   -- Line 1: N, M, positive integers, numbers of residents and hospitals respectively
   -- Lines 2..N+1: the resident preference lists, each has form X : A B C ...
   -- where X is the owner and A, B, C, ... are entries in order;
   -- Lines N+2..M+N+1: the hospital preference lists, each has form X : P : A B C ...
   -- where X is the owner, P is the number of posts, and A, B, C, ... are entries in order;
   -- identifiers are arbitrary strings of up to 20 chars
   
-- Assumptions
   -- each preference list is on a single line, with no trailing blanks
   -- number of lists corresponds to input values of n and m
   -- lists need not be complete, nor need they be consistent
